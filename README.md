As a seasoned software development engineer with 5 years of experience, I have been primarily focused on Automated Testing using Python. Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work for renowned organizations such as Unisys Corporation, Lockheed Martin's Advanced Technologies Laboratory, and most recently Comcast NBC Universal.

Proficient in many languages including Python, C, C++, C#, and Java, I have successfully contributed to various software development projects. However, my true passion lies in projects involving Automated Testing and Continuous Integration/Deployment. I thoroughly enjoy leveraging my skills to create robust testing frameworks and streamline software delivery processes.

I am a dedicated professional who embraces a lifelong learning mindset. I constantly strive to stay updated with the latest advancements in software development and testing methodologies, ensuring that my skills remain at the cutting edge of the industry. With a strong foundation in programming and a keen eye for detail, I am ready to take on new challenges and make significant contributions to the success of your organization.

Beyond my professional endeavors, I indulge in various hobbies that bring me joy and relaxation. I am an avid Bassist, finding solace in creating music and exploring different genres. Additionally, I am a Puzzle Enthusiast, challenging myself with brain-teasers and logic puzzles in my spare time. Lastly, I am a Home Mechanic who takes pleasure in the art of rebuilding and restoring automobiles, currently focusing on a 1987 Toyota Supra.

With my technical expertise, passion for automation, and commitment to personal growth, I am eager to embark on my next professional journey. I look forward to applying my skills and contributing to a team that shares my drive for excellence and innovation.
